# Guidance for Agentic Workflows for Intelligent Dental Order Processing on AWS

## Overview

This repository provides an automated dental order processing system that streamlines order submission, verification, and approval processes. The solution helps dental laboratories reduce manual processing time, minimize errors, and provide better customer experience through AI-powered order processing and validation.

## Key Features

- Intelligent dental order processing
- Automated data extraction from dental orders
- Real-time order validation and verification
- Automated dental order form completion
- Interactive chatbot for dental order assistance
- Tooth position validation using FDI numbering system
- Product and material compatibility verification

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./packages/webapp/src/assets/architecture.png)

### Provisioned Resources

The system creates and manages:
- Bedrock data automation blueprints for data extraction
- Bedrock multi-agents for order verification and validation
- Secure order storage system
- Order form auto-completion
- Order confirmation generation
- Chatbot integration for dentists and technicians

## Demo Script

The demo script, use case, and persona is provided here: [Demo Script](/docs/demoscript/demo-script.md)

## Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites

1. AWS account 
2. Create IAM role/user with [IAM policy](./docs/iam-policy.json) for deployment
3. AWS CLI (v2.x or later)
4. For Linux/EC2 users, this application requires ARM architecture
5. [Install node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), node.js 22 is recommended
6. [Get started with CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html), and [bootstrap your environment for use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping-env.html)
7. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/), because we are bundling Lambda functions when running CDK so we need to install Docker. Please see the blog post about [Building, bundling and deploying applications with the AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/building-apps-with-aws-cdk/)
8. [Run aws configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configure/set.html) to set up region
```bash
aws configure set region YOUR_REGION
```
9. [Enable models in Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html), for this use case, you need to enable Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Install npm modules
```bash
cd bedrock-agentic-dental-assistant
npm run install-packages
```
3. Deploy the backend and frontend
```bash
npm run deploy-all
```
To deploy the backend only
```bash
npm run deploy-backend
```
To deploy the frontend only
```bash
npm run deploy-frontend
```
4. Access to the application from [Cloudfront distribution URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/GettingStarted.SimpleDistribution.html), you can get this URL from the Cloudformation output with script:
```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $(aws cloudformation list-stacks --stack-status-filter CREATE_COMPLETE UPDATE_COMPLETE | jq -r '.StackSummaries[] | select(.StackName | startswith("DentalAssistantwebsitewafstack")) | .StackName') --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`configwebsitedistributiondomain`].OutputValue' --output text
```
5. [Create cognito user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/how-to-create-user-accounts.html#creating-a-new-user-using-the-console) in the user pool to access the application
6. Delete the stack. We recommend using the AWS CloudFormation service page to delete/manage your CDK stacks as it offers many options to monitor stack drifts, identify errors, and provides better stability. 

Note: 
- The deletion will fail if your S3 bucket is not empty
- The WAF stack deletion takes 15-20 minutes
- If CloudFormation deletion fails, review and manually delete these resources in the AWS Console:
  - Bedrock Agents
  - Bedrock Data Automation project
  - Lambda functions and their associated CloudWatch log groups
  - IAM roles
  - Any remaining S3 buckets and their contents

## Cost Estimation
- Approximate cost: The Dental Assistant Application will cost $226 per month for 1,000 orders, 28,800 requests (us-east-1 region, April 2025)
- Recommend setting up [AWS Budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html)

### Cost Breakdown

Below you can see the estimated costs of the guidance solution and the assumptions.

| AWS service | Dimensions | Cost [USD] |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Amazon Bedrock Data Automation    | 1,000 orders processed with Bedrock Data Automation     | $40  |
| Amazon Bedrock Agent - Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2    | Average 2 requests to the Bedrock agent per minute, input tokens 1000 per request, output tokens 200 per request    | $173    |
| AWS Lambda    | 28,800 requests per month on Arm with 512 MB ephemeral storage, 30s execution time     | $0.32     |
| Amazon EventBridge    | 1 million events     | $1     |
| Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)   |  S3 Standard storage (10 GB per month)     | $0.24     |
| Amazon CloudFront      | Data transfer out to internet cost: $0.85 and Data transfer out to origin cost: $0.20 (10 GB per month), 28,000 requests cost: $0.03  |  $1.08   |
| Amazon Cognito     | 100 monthly active users (MAU) with Advanced security feature (WAF)     | $10.75    |

### FAQ
Q: Why isn't the review page showing the order list?

A: If you're not seeing the order list on the review page, try clicking the `Clear` Button to refresh the view.

Q: How can I clear my conversation history and terminate the current session?

A: We use `userId` to track conversation history. To clear the history and terminate the current session, simply click the `Clear Chat` button in the chat interface.

Q: Why are S3 buckets and CloudWatch logs still in my account?

A: The S3 buckets and CloudWatch log groups are intentionally retained in your account as a safety measure to prevent accidental data loss during stack removal. To completely remove these resources, you'll need to manually delete them through the AWS Console or AWS CLI - first empty the S3 bucket contents before deletion, and CloudWatch log groups can be deleted directly.
